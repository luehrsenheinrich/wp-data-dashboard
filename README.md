# WP Data Dashboard

This project aims to gather, combine, analyze, and visualize data from different sources within the WordPress ecosystem. The main goal is to provide a dashboard that can be used by anyone to gain a better understanding of the state of the WordPress ecosystem.

You can access the dashboard at [wp-data-dashboard.com](http://wp-data-dashboard.com).

## Modules

The project gathers data for different modules, with each module being responsible for providing data for a specific part of the WordPress ecosystem.

### Theme Repository

The Theme Repository module gathers data from the WordPress theme repository. It provides data about the themes available in the repository, their authors, and their performance over time. This module can also be used to measure trends in the WordPress theme ecosystem.

### Stats

*Usage Score* represents the effectiveness of a theme based on its active installs and total downloads. A high score indicates a theme that not only has been downloaded frequently but also remains actively installed on many sites. The score undergoes a significant decay if the proportion of active installs to downloads is low, indicating that while the theme might be frequently downloaded, it's not retained by users. This metric provides insight into both the initial appeal of a theme and its lasting utility to users.

*Diversity Score* quantifies the distribution of theme downloads among different authors on a scale from 0% to 100%. A high score indicates that downloads are spread across many authors, suggesting a diverse and competitive marketplace. On the other hand, a low score suggests that a few authors dominate the downloads, indicating less diversity. This metric provides insight into the variety of theme offerings and the balance of power in the theme marketplace.
